## Design Guidelines

Transitions, like many facets of visual and interaction design, can be highly subjective. Maintaining a consistent library of transitions in an active community can be difficult; these design guidelines are designed to help encourage thoughtful criticism of new transitions that are proposed for transition.css.

The transitions in transition.css should follow a few key principles:

- **Transitions should be tolerable.** Transitions should be tolerable, seeing them repeatedly should not become too annoying or overbearing.
- **Transitions should not interfere with document flow or control/input availability.** In other words, the absence of an transition should never reduce usability of a product: they should be non-critical and seen as “progressive enhancements”.
- **Transitions should be helpful.** They should be designed to move users through moments of interest, ease natural reading order, or to communicate relationships between spaces.
- **Transitions should feel familial.** Avoid introducing transitions that feel out-of-place compared to the existing set.
- **Transitions should feel natural.** Transitions should reflect, as much as is reasonable, motion that occurs in natural physics. Avoid extreme timing functions, and model transitions on real-world events.
- **Transitions shouldn't run on devices without the power to do so.** If a device is contrained in battery, memory, GPU, etc, then it's a good idea to avoid transitions.
